    First of all let me introduce myself, I'm just an ordinary person whose <br>
    passion for bartending was born at a younger age, when I was only searching<br>
    for a summer job just to make some extra cash for myself, but not knowing<br>
    I would find something way better than just a summer job, i found my passion.<br>

            I began my journey at a local café bar in my town,
            with not a single drop of experience in me, I did not give up and went along the way
            without skipping any steps and carefully learning from the older
            more experience colleagues, the first two weeks I wasn't even paid for my work
            because I was new and unexperienced. Two months pass and next thing you know
            I'm catching up to my colleagues in experience. Third month go by and I get a praise
            from the owner of the bar for my fast learning, and love for the work.

                My love for making cocktails was born when I just learned to make
                a simple cocktail with simple ingredients, that being the Blue Lagoon
                a few weeks in and compliments from the customers started flooding in
                we saw a huge increase in cocktail sales, which in return gave me motivation
                to learn new recipes for other cocktails, I did start off with simple ones
                but because I poured will and love into it, they came out perfect
                which the customers really loved. Having learned all the cocktails
                on our menu, I was already gaining and edge above the experience of my colleagues
                which surprisingly they embraced and supported me.

                As time went by, a new owner bought the café, he was more than fair
                and brought more life in it with new renovations, some menu changes
                and was rather humble and open to suggestions on improvements, as he knew
                that we understand what's missing and how the bar should operate.
                I took the chance and suggested that we buy more ingredients for a wider
                range of cocktails, and also some other improvements like changing the coffe
                for a better one, new coffe machine, new and better milk for latte art etc.
                He did accept the suggestions and next thing you know I have many new possible
                cocktail combinations and even room for some experiments. This was the key point to
                advancing my knowledge and skill to an expert level.
